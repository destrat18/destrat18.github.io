I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/). I am fortunate to be supervised by [Prof. Goharshady](https://amir.goharshady.com/home) and [Prof. Shen](https://shenjiasi.com/). My research focuses on designing automated algorithms for optimization problems and program verification, mainly in the context of blockchain and recently AI.
