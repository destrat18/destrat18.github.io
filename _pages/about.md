I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science and Engineering at the [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://www.ust.hk/). I am fortunate to be co-supervised by [Prof. Amir Goharshady](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~amir/) and [Prof. Jiasi Shen](https://www.cse.ust.hk/~jiasi/). Previously, I obtained my MPhil at the same university.

Research Interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection of formal methods and blockchain programs, specifically smart contracts. Smart contracts are self-enforcing agreements that currently in control of digital assets value millions of pounds. However, the notorious difficulty in verifying smart contracts has led to vulnerabilities that have cost communities millions of pounds, exemplified by the 2016 DAO attack which resulted in the loss of 50 million pounds. My research aims to develop sound and scalable techniques to automatically verify smart contracts, ensuring their correctness.
